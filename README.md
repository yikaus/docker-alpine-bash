# Run bash in alpine docker 

It is my test on building a docker image based on small [alpine docker image] , you can build images less 50MB or even 10 MB

I also made [self built base image] , and use it as base container . 

# Instructions

- Run bash

```
docker pull yikaus/alpine-bash
docker run --rm -ti yikaus/alpine-bash /bin/bash
```

- Check available package can be built on alpine

```
docker pull gliderlabs/alpine
docker run --rm gliderlabs/alpine /sbin/apk --update search -v PKG_NAME
```

example:
```
docker run --rm gliderlabs/alpine /sbin/apk --update search -v nginx
```

- Directly running shell on base image

```
docker run --rm -ti gliderlabs/alpine /bin/sh
```
